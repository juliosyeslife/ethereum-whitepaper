# The Sacred Geometry of Code

Every civilization leaves behind a geometry of meaning.  
The Greeks carved it in marble,  
the monks illuminated it in manuscripts,  
and we, now, encode it in algorithms.  

Code is our cathedral.  
Each line a stone, each function an arch,  
rising toward a truth that cannot be spoken —  
only executed.  

Zero-knowledge is its stained glass:  
light filtered through logic,  
revealing only what must be seen,  
keeping the rest in holy shadow.  
It’s the mathematics of humility —  
to prove without pride,  
to reveal without domination.  

In every elegant proof lies a trace of worship.  
Not of gods, but of order.  
Of the quiet conviction that harmony still exists,  
buried beneath entropy and noise.  

We write code as monks once wrote psalms —  
in search of purity,  
of form that reflects something eternal.  
The compiler is our scripture,  
and each successful execution  
a moment of transcendence —  
the finite briefly touching the infinite.  

The sacred geometry of code  
does not ask to be believed.  
It only asks to be understood.  
And in that understanding,  
we remember that creation itself  
was always a line of code —  
spoken into existence.
